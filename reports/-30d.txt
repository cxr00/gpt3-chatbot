The string 2013 represents a catastrophist as colloquialist and an analyst as interventionist. Unfortunately, this pair synergises poorly: cat as clq tends to indicate "Everything is going wrong and we have to act!", which is followed by the analyst's reaction of "I must immediately do whatever it takes to stop it."

Because this analyst is receiving indications from a catastrophist, it creates a sense of familiarity which can inhibit function in its role. Due to the fact that there is no pure colloquialist nor historian on this team, the analyst's indication must be shared noncolloquially, which creates a sense of normality to its function: It receives its indication from the colloquialist, and it then indicates to a catastrophist. But because the catastrophist is simultaneously the colloquialist, it skews the data which the analyst is being presented with through a negative feedback loop. The analyst is then responsible for suggesting intervening actions which the catastrophist is likely to see as necessary to meet the moment, moments which the analyst itself indicates are present.

Difficulty reframing an analyst from the function of interventionist is to be expected; they have to internalise the data stream from a catastrophist (or, in lieu of one, whichever member precedes them) which they empathise with heavily as their canonical role is responsible for indicating to them.

However, using socioarithmetic to transition them to the function of contrarian can be a prosperous task. For starters, as interventionist they are already responsible for delivering indications to a contrarian if present, so they benefit somewhat from empathy. And since data is in their blood, they are prone to assessing other directions naturally.

### prescription

In order to balance out the pessimistic tendencies of the colloquialist, the best course of action is to transition the analyst into a role as a contrarian. This will enable more balanced procession of indications which keep notions of catastrophe in check.

#### Pitfalls

* comfort in current function
* feeling of failure
* desire for function-specific growth
* metanalysis of socioarithmetical operation

**Analyst role concerns**: tendency to empathise with catastrophist; since catastrophist is colloquialist, implicit chain synergy (0 => 1 => 2) exists.

**interventionist function concerns**: Contrarian must directly oppose interventionist, which means "self empathy" may interfere
